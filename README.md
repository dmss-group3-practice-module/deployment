## Commands

### Docker

```sh
# starts up services in listed in `docker-compose.yml`
docker-compose up

# starts up services detached listed in `docker-compose.yml`
docker-compose up -d

docker-compose down
```

### Load Test

[Artillery](https://artillery.io/) is used as the tool for load testing. Ensure that Artillery is [installed](https://www.artillery.io/docs/get-started/get-artillery) before running the script below.

```sh
artillery run load-test.yml
```

## Continuous Delivery

Continuous Deployment is done using [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

This repository is the target repository for both [frontend](https://github.com/mtechse-dmss-capstone/frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/mtechse-dmss-capstone/backend) to update the image versions of the kubernetes YML files. Upon a successful merge of a pull request to the main branch in the frontend/backend repository, the CI pipeline will update the image version of the kubernetes YML files in this repository. There will be an ArgoCD agent in the kubernetes cluster on hosted on DigitalOcean which listens to version changes in this repository.
